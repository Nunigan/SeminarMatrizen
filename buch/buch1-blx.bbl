    In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search
  engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is
  designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more
  satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full
  text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at
  http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging
  task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages
  involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions
  of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on
  the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore,
  due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web
  search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper
  provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the
  first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the
  problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude,
  there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional
  information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper
  addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which
  can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at
  the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext
  collections where anyone can publish anything they want.%
